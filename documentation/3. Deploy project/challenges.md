We've had problems with kepping the aplication running so we've used this command "nohup go run . > output.log 2>&1 &".

## Migration challenges
We fear that we might have created a lot of technical debt during the rewriting of the project.
That is because of our deadline, functionality is not tested properly.
Because of the deadline and the new language, our understanding of the code might be insufficient.
We will have to implement something to reduce the amount of technical debt we probably will have.
