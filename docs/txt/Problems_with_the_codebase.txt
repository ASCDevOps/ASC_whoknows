environment variables doesn't seem to be setup correctly in html templates, neither css link.
I think this is because the dependencies in requirements.txt are discontinued and isn't supported by Python3 which app.py has been converted to via 2to3.
also in app.py a problem occurs with flask "import "flask" could not be resolved"
Doesn't look like regular html, have to look into what is used. (flask?)
